Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.

Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!
Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.

A person's a person, no matter how small.

You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.

The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.

I meant what I said and I said what I meant.

You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.

Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.

I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.
